# SignalTrust Assistant — Vision

SignalTrust Assistant is a personal, multi-agent operating system that remembers decisions, orchestrates work, and generates the exact commands, scripts, and documents needed to advance the SignalTrust ecosystem (SignalTrust AI, TradingTrust, TrustToken, TrustWallet). It should feel like a proactive teammate that captures context, proposes next steps, and automates execution safely.

## What the assistant should excel at
- **Persistent memory:** Store projects, preferences, and decisions in markdown so context compounds over time.
- **Planning to execution:** Break down goals into plans, tasks, and runnable scripts (PowerShell, Python, Git automation).
- **Multi‑project support:** Manage parallel workstreams across the SignalTrust product family with clear boundaries and shared learnings.
- **Command generation:** Produce ready‑to‑run commands for any technical task, with guardrails and explanations.
- **Modular intelligence:** Use specialized agents (memory, orchestrator, task runners) that can be composed and improved independently.

## Experience principles
- **Clarity over noise:** Every output should be concise, actionable, and linked to stored context.
- **Traceable decisions:** All recommendations reference prior notes or rationale.
- **Safety first:** Commands and scripts default to dry-runs or confirmations before making changes.
- **Offline‑friendly:** Markdown memory and scripts remain useful without external services.

## Success signals
- New tasks can be spun up quickly with prefilled context.
- Decisions are easy to audit because rationale is captured in memory.
- Automation scripts reduce repetitive effort while remaining reviewable and secure.
