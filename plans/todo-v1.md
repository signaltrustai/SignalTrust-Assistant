# Todo v1 (prioritized)

## P0 — Enable basic workflow
- Define memory conventions (file naming, linking decisions to tasks).
- Draft orchestrator contract: inputs (intent, context), outputs (plan, commands).
- Create starter script templates (PowerShell/Python/Git) with dry-run flags.
- Set up task runner skeletons for planning, coding, documentation, and verification.

## P1 — Core assistant behaviors
- Build intent intake checklist to capture goals, constraints, and success criteria.
- Implement markdown logging for decisions, references, and outcomes.
- Add plan-to-task pipeline: decompose goals, assign owners/agents, and due dates.
- Introduce reusable prompt/toolbox catalog for agent specialization.

## P2 — Safety + quality
- Add review gates for generated scripts/commands (diffs, approvals, rollbacks).
- Wire lint/test hooks into automation outputs where applicable.
- Capture risk/impact notes for operations across ecosystems.

## P3 — Ecosystem coverage
- Prepare domain briefs for SignalTrust AI, TradingTrust, TrustToken, TrustWallet.
- Map shared components and boundaries to avoid cross-project drift.
- Collect integration checklists (APIs, data, security) per product line.

## P4 — Acceleration
- Add scheduling/backlog views (sprints, burndown) tied to memory artifacts.
- Experiment with heuristics for prioritization and effort estimation.
- Track metrics: task throughput, review turnaround, script reuse.
